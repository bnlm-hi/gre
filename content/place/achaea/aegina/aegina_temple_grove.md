## Dates

pre-464 BCE to 2nd century CE

## Garden Description

Evidence for a temple grove on Aegina exists only in a literary reference. Pausanias [(2.29.6)](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.29.6) wrote that the shrine of Aiakos was surrounded by a grove of olive trees. Pausanias says that it had been there since ancient times, and a reference in 464 B.C. to the grove in Pindar's *Olympian Odes* [(13.109)](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0033.tlg001.perseus-eng1:13) confirms that it was much older. This sanctuary was located in a prominent spot in the harbor town and was enclosed within a wall built of white stone. At the time of Pausanias' travels in Greece in the 2nd century A.D., the temple grove was still to be seen.
