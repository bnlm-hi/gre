## Province Description

## Location

<!-- {{< id vocab="Pleiades" id="108751" name="Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Cologne)" >}} -->

## Sublocation

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.
