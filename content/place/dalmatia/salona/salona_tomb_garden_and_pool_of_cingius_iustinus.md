## Sublocation

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden Description

A rock cut inscription at Salonae marks the spot where some time in the late second or third century Cingius Iustinus made a fishpond or pool (piscina) in the garden of his wife Aelia Licinia for her and for himself (*fecit piscinam in horto Aeliae Liciniae coiugi incomparabili et sibi*). No tomb is mentioned, but the dedication *D(is) M(anibus)* identifies the text as an epitaph and thus points to a funerary context.
