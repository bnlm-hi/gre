## Province Description

An ancient district of Africa in Roman times, Mauretania lay west of Numidia and covered most of present-day Morocco and western Algeria. By the second century BCE, when Jugurtha of Numidia was rebelling against Rome, Jugurtha's father-in-law Bocchus had most of Mauretania under his control. In 25 BCE Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of Mauretania. Claudius divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis, with Caesarea (modern Cherchel) as capital, and Mauretania Tingitana, with Tingis (modern Tangier) as capital. By the end of the 5th century CE, the province had disappeared.

Square in overall aspect, front side of the house faced almost due east. A small entrance was at the southern end of this wall, with the square-sided atrium occupying a corner of the house and opening into the large central peristyle. Other rooms surrounded this rectangular peristyle on all sides, forming the square shape of the building. Only two of these rooms (those in the southwest corner of the house) are linked by an interior hallway, with the other ten opening only into the peristyle." >}}
