## Garden Description

[Philostratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philostratus) ([Life of Apollonius of Tyana, 7.32](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0638.tlg001.perseus-grc1:7.32)) writes of the *Adonea*, a garden sacred to Adonis, in the [Flavian Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavian_Palace) on the Palatine where [Apollonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Tyana) and [Domitian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Domitian) met. It is also where the emperor had made a sacrifice to [Minerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva) in the hall of [Adonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis) that was overflowing with flowers in vases.  It was proposed in the nineteenth century that this *Adonea* was in the area of the [Vigna Barberini](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigna_Barberini) and that a fragment of the [Severan Forma Urbis (*FUR*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forma_Urbis_Romae) partially depicts it.  Recent excavations do not support such a location for the *Adonea*, and the marble fragment could represent the Severan *Adonea* that was in Trastevere.  Flowers in vases, such as were part of the cult activities to Adonis, do not necessarily indicate a planted garden, although the marble fragment, with its symmetrical lines and rows of dots, likely render schematically formal garden plantings.
