## Garden Description

This temple site was excavated in 1764-1766 and although, as Jashemski points out, it was likely that there was a sacred garden surrounding it, she could find no evidence of plantings remaining when she examined it. Ceremonies in a garden in front of a temple of Isis were depicted in two paintings found in Herculaneum (Mus. Naz. inv. nos. 8924, 8919; Ruesch nos. 1346, 1347). Gardens were often part of the cult of Egyptian temples.
