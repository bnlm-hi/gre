## Garden Description

This house was excavated in 1885. The entrance at 37 went into the atrium and beyond that, up two steps, was the peristyle with a portico on three sides supported by stuccoed columns, only three of which have remained to date. The first intercolumniation on the north-east was filled with a wall. A gutter surrounded this area, which was paved, with a narrow masonry pool at the south end. All that remained of the pool was a depression in the pavement. Potted plants would have been placed around the pool and the area would have served as a garden. Terraces overlooking the bay and mountains were located on the street level and one level lower at the back of the houses, and a portico was built just before the lower terrace at the back of house 36.
