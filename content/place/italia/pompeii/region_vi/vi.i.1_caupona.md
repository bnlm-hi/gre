[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden Description

Just inside the *Porta di Ercolano* was a small inn pressed against the city wall that had a garden with a masonry *triclinium* (l. *medius*, 3.95 m.; *l. imus* 4.00; *l. summus* 3.75 m.). A vine covered pergola had provided shade to the *triclinium* and the sockets in the back wall where the pergola roof supports fitted were visible when this area was excavated in 1787. Rooms upstairs provided overnight accommodations for guests. A cistern opening in the southwest corner of the garden received water from a gutter that ran along the south edge.
