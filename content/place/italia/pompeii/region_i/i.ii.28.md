## Garden

[Peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) garden at the rear of the Casa Della Grata Metallica (also known as the Casa Dell'Atrio Tetra-Stilo).

## Garden Description

At the rear of the house there was a [peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) garden with a [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) along the east side and part of the south. The excavation took place in 1873-74. A low wall joined three stuccoed brick [columns](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571) and two engaged ones which supported the [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145). There was an entrance to the garden on the south side opposite the door from the [tablinum](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004180) and another on the east opposite the kitchen door, which was closed later according to Mau. The [columns](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571) were white above the height of the wall and red below. Water was carried to the [cistern](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558) by a wide gutter on the south and east edges of the garden, and Mau found some evidence of aqueduct water. There was a masonry [triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359) (l. medius, 5.30 m; l. imus, 3.85 m; l. summus, 2.70 m) with a circular table (dia. of support, 0.70 m) built against the west wall. Inside of each couch there were four niches (0.19 m wide). The last niche in the south couch was larger in size and separated from the other three by the mouth of the [cistern](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558). There was a small masonry podium on the north wall with steps for access. A round tufa altar was located opposite the *lectus summus*.
