## Garden

Shop property with peristyle garden and doghouse.

## Garden Description

This modest house had rooms opening off the small [peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) garden at the rear of the structure. The rooms had been remodeled to serve as a shop and at the time of the eruption, were in disrepair. Four [columns](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571), two of tufa, two of brick, supported the [peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) on the north and east sides and were connected by a low wall with an entrance to the garden on the east side. A terra-cotta puteal was located on the east side of the [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145). The house to the rear was completely destroyed necessitated the building of a crude doghouse in the last intercolumniation on the east side. Keeping a dog would have prevented intruders from entering through the ruins and robbing the shop as well as the adjacent house (no. 11) where the shopkeeper most likely resided.
